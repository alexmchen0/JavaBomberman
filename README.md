# JavaBomberman
The classic video game Bomberman programmed in Java. Created during my junior year of high school (Spring 2015) with [Kevin Chen](https://github.com/kevinbc0)

**Edit from 2018** - This project has pretty terrible coding style (so much repeated code...) and isn't the most flushed-out product, but I'm still really proud of it. Completed after a year of coding, this project helped me see how much was really possible with programming and made me certain about my decision to go into computer science.

**Description:**
- Programmed game mechanics such as power ups, basic movement, and precise hitbox detection
- Integrated graphical user interface, animation, and sound effects using JPanel, EventListeners, Timers, etc.
- Utilized encapsulation and other OOP principles to save and relay information about blocks, players, bombs, etc.
