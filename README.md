# JavaBomberman
The classic video game Bomberman programmed in Java
Created during my junior year of high school (March - June 2015)
Sorry for the somewhat poor coding style and lack of comments, I'd be happy to show improvements to my style and skills in an interview or coding challenge :]

Description:
Created the multiplayer video game Bomberman entirely in Java
Programmed game mechanics such as power ups, basic movement, and precise hitbox detection
Integrated graphical user interface, animation, and sound effects using JPanel, EventListeners, Timers, etc.
Utilizes encapsulation and other OOP principles to save and relay information about blocks, players, bombs, etc.
